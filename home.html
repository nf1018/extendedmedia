 <!---For this project, I wanted to explore data and data collection through text and imagery and decided to create an image essay through code.
 
This essay features three different neighbordhoods in Philly through various screenshots taken of Google Earth.
 
Especially in the United States, it is impossible to not have a photo of yourself or your property taken if the Google Earth car passes by you or your property.
 
Since these images are taken on public property, capturing what the lense sees isn't illegal--but Google makes sure to blur out human faces and a property owner can request their building is blurred.
 
From fears of burglars studying Google Maps to make break-in plans to protected privacy of human trafficking victims, there are lots of different reasons that one might want or need to blurr their property.
 
But Google warns: Once a property is blurred, it cannot be undone.
 
And future photos, regardless if there is a new property owner, will be blurred too.
 
 
 
 
Because of community access pushes to maintain privacy and the innaccesibility of some roads, many parts of the world are not accurately or recently covered.
 
When you attempt to view these areas, you may run into some glitches and the program may show you a computer-generated image of what the area may have looked like in photos last taken in the area.
 
In South Philly's Queen Village, where roads are compact, one-way, and roads are not very wide, Google has not documented this neighborhood since the early to mid 90's.
 
As a result, exploring the country's oldest continually occupied residential neighborhood is very tricky.
 
 

 
I created this essay in the hopes of bringing to light questions of privacy, accesbility, and representation. 
 
How does data mitigated the way we see the world and ourselves?
 
If data collection provides so many holes and does not represent every pocket of a community, how can this be improved?
 
While I don't necessarily have answers to these questions, I throughout beleive going forward tech needs to be concerned about these questions surrounding humanity.




This essay can be read and interperated in three ways:

(1) With just the images and no text

(2) With the texts and page source hand-in-hand --OR--

(3) Page source code only.>
